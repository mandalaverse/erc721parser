# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

To specify a network, run as such:
```
npx hardhat node
```
to run a localhost node if you're using localhost network, then in a separate terminal: 
```
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```
